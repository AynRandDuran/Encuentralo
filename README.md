# Encuentralo
An attempt at a computerized version of the card game Spot It for use in class rooms with custom symbols.
Please don't sue me. 

## Use
I should probably upload the exe generated by Dolphin some day. If you really want just throw every class in a package and deploy it yourself.

Just give it a good ol' double-click and you're good to go. Use the folder selector to add folders of images with which to play. BMP, PNG, and JPG images are supported.

Any resolution can be used but I would recommend no less than 100x100 for the sake of it not looking terrible. Images are forced to be square to make arranging them easier, so avoid particularly rectangular images or they'll look weird. Use at least 15 total images for proper play, though there is no upper limit.

After that, just click play to start. Click the cycle button to "draw" cards until you're done playing, or the eventual heat-death of the universe.
